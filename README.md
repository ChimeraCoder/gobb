# gobb
A simple forum platform written in Go. 

## Work in progress
This project is waaay not ready for the public yet. I only put it up so early because one of my friends was interested in seeing what was causing me to pester him with Go questions so much (thanks [Aditya](http://github.com/chimeracoder)!).

Feel free to browse around and check back, but this project is not ready yet!
